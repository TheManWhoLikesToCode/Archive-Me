# Blackboard-Scrapper
The Blackboard Scrapper is a tool for students to easily archive and track their course materials and grades from Blackboard. It helps students store and organize their coursework for long-term access and reference. This scraper is useful for college students preserving their academic record and high schoolers preparing for future studies.-


This web scraper is specifically designed for kettering University students to extract their course information from the Blackboard login page. It uses the Selenium webdriver and Python to automate the login process and extract the necessary data. Please note that this tool is only intended for use by Kettering University students. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to users from other institutions.
